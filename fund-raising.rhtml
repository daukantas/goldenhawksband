<h2>PNC Center Concessions</h2>

<p>Contact
Glenn Oliver at <span class="iea">gnboliver at yahoo dot com</span>.

<p>We use
<a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/">Sign Up Genius</a>
to arrange who is working when.

<p>We are in the process of organizing our PNC Center Fundraiser and are
scheduling BAR Training.  This fundraiser is not just for Marching Band,
but all HSHS band programs.  Working at the PNC center was one of the
more successful fundraisers last year.  It’s an excellent and fun way to
earn money for the band, and add money to your student’s account.  To
receive notifications to work events I need you to email
Glenn Oliver at <span class="iea">gnboliver at yahoo dot com</span>
with your intent (leader or worker), whether or not
you want to receive BAR Training (see below for more info) and your
contact information including phone number where you can easily be
reached.  We generally do not use the Google Group to send out
notifications for PNC Center events and only notify those who have
expressed interest.  There is a separate SignUp Genius group for the PNC
Fundraiser and you will need to be added to that group to receive
notifications.

<p>The difference between a Leader and a worker is the leader is
responsible for handling all the money and may have to put in a little
more time at the PNC Center.  We prefer all leaders be BAR trained as
the leader will cover breaks and will work the register at some point
each event.  If you are only interested in working NCSU basketball games
where alcohol is not served then the BAR Training will not be necessary.
 The PNC Center does schedule training for new leaders and we will send
that information along once we receive it.

<p>The following is a list of dates and times still available for BAR
Training.  Please send me your top three choices so I can get you
scheduled.  The information that follows is directly from the PNC
Volunteer coordinator and gives instructions on where to park and what
you can and can’t bring.
