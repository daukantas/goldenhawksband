<p>Please see information below provided by WCPSS Human Resources on the
volunteer process for the 2012-2013 school year. Please share with
appropriate groups/volunteers. The following information describes the
procedures for reactivation for continuing volunteers, the process for
new volunteers to obtain CRC clearance, and a summary of the appeal
procedures.

<h4>Reactivation for Continuing Volunteers</h4>

<ul>

Access to the volunteer system is: WCPSS Intranet – Business
Applications – Volunteer Registration. 
<li> After October 31, 2012,
individuals previously approved may not volunteer without a new criminal
record check. To avoid unnecessary costs to the school system,
principals and their staff should encourage continuing volunteers to
reactivate early in the school year – and no later than October 31,
2012. 
<li> The volunteer system will be open daily for
reactivation/registration from July 2, 2012, through October 31, 2012

the following Mondays: December 24, 2012, December 31, 2012, and January

<h4>New Volunteers for 2012-2013</h4>
